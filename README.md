## **Introduction**  
MediSight is a mobile application designed to assist individuals in identifying and managing minor wounds through machine learning-based image classification. The app aims to address the lack of reliable guidance for self-treatment, which often results in improper care and delayed healing.  

### Key Features:  
- **Wound Classification**: Detect wound types such as burns, cuts, bruises, and abrasions.  
- **Care Recommendations (Step and Product)**: Provide product suggestions and detailed steps for wound treatment.  
- **Reminders**: Send care reminders to promote consistent and effective wound management.  
- **Wound Care Article**: Enhance public awareness about proper wound care and self-treatment practices.
